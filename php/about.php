	<h1>About <a href="index.php"> WordQuake </a></h1>

	<h2>How it Works</h2>
	WordQuake runs on <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">WordNet</a>, a 
	database developed at Princeton University that maps the relationships
 	between tens of thousands of words in the English language. Our program
 	accesses this database to analyze your text on the fly and 
 	hands you back a unique blend of chaos and creativity.
 	<br><br>
 	<p>"Get your concepts rank, then you can distort them as you please."<br>-- Mark Twain via WordQuake</p>

 	<h2>Chrome Extension</h2>
 	Use it to transform entire webpages in a single click.
 	The Chrome Extension utilizes the same algorithm and database as the demo on
 	the homepage, but its ability to WordQuake other sites makes it even more powerful. 
 	Find it on the Chrome store here.
